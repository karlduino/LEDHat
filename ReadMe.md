## LED Hat

I sewed 5 RGB neopixel LEDs onto a black winter hat, arranged like the
corners of a pentagram, with an Adafruit
[Gemma](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1222). This repository
contains various programs for them.

It seemed that coin cell batteries weren't going to work, so I bought
a couple of small lipo batteries, but their connectors are the
"Losi/Walkera" type, while the Gemma has a JST-PH connector, so I
bought some connectors with pig tails and soldered them together to
make an adapter.
